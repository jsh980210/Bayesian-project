# Bayesian-project
The project is focused on Bayesian methods on binary response data. The purpose of this project is to explore the performance of different methods while constructing Bayesian models, while the response data is binary. We consider using different link functions in the binary regression model, which is a generalization of the linear regression model. Also, we explore the difference between posterior distributions of parameters while using different prior distributions.  

In this project, we use a data set of images of banknotes. The response variable is encoded as 0 (authentic) or 1 (forgery) and there are 4 predictor variables, which are variance, skewness, kurtosis and entropy of images.

As a result of all methods, it's likely that the probability of a banknote to be forgery has a positive correlation with entropy, and a negative correlation with variance, skewness and kurtosis.
